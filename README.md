# surepetcare

**dev** branch of the Home Assistant surepetcare integration. dev branch means "maybe it works, maybe not..." ;)

...and maybe you need also to use the latest (pre) release or even the dev branch of https://github.com/benleb/surepy!

...and you have to change `surepetcare` in your `configuration.yaml` to `surepetcarebeta` if you used the official integration before!
